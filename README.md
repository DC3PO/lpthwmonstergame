# lpthwmonstergame
This is the first game I had to build from the book, Learn Python the Hard Way

I am having trouble with the monster_room function.  No matter what you input, it will always choose the elif choice (elif choice > 5:...).  How do I get it to read the input correctly?  This is my first game and I know it's very basic and probably looks rough.  If there are any other improvments you see that can be made, please let me know.  Thank you!
